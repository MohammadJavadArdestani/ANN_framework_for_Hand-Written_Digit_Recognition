# Hand-Written Digit Recognition by Neural Network

The following main components are implemented from scratch in this pattern recognition project :
* Adaptable architecture for Feed-forward Fully Connected Neural Network. You can change the number of cells, layers, and the activation function to customize NN for your usage. 
*  Feed-forward and back-propagation methods are implemented in two different ways for Comparison of memory consumption and run time: 
    *  For loop iteration 
    *  NumPy Vectorization 
  
* Measurement of the impact of adversarial attacks by shifting digit pattern matrices.
